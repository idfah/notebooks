# Elliott's Notebooks

Welcome to my personal Jupyter Notebooks repository!  This is where I keep notebooks and presentations the describe interesting stories and experiments related to machine learning and data science.  Some of these notebooks are fairly well filled out while others remain a work in progress.  In any case, I hope you enjoy looking them over and feel free to let me know if you have any thoughts or questions!  Please note that these notebooks are __not__ licencsed for redistribution unless specificlly noted.  If you would like to use these in your work, please file a GitHub issue describing why and how you will use them.
